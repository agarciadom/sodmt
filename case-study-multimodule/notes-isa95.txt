Bad points:

* Supply chain is not modelled

* Units are not modelled well: what about conversion factors, products and fractions? There should also be a mapping between the custom units created by the user and the internal units of the system (the "Day" type should be mapped to a "system day" type for some business operations). This shouldn't be overlooked so easily.

* Alternative process segments for producing something are not explicitly modelled a priori

* Setup/teardown times need to be approximated with extra segments

* Steps transforming the same material? Should we have 1 material class for every state, or requirements on the properties?

* The 'Process Segment Capability' and 'Production Capability' models are pretty much the same (lots of duplication). Same for properties.

* Process segment properties have both 'value' and 'quantity' (confusing?)

Good points:

* Separation between available steps and steps for a product

Questions:

* How to represent the fact that we need to reserve a rectifying line while we're producing a lot? Product segments need to be associated
  with a process segment, but process segments can only have one parent, so we can't use a parent process segment to specify this.

  For the time being, we allow product segments with no process segments, that are only used for resource allocation.

* How to distinguish material capabilities due to production capabilities to those from current stock?

  For the time being, we could have two PC without start/end times, "Raw Materials" and "Daily Capabilities".
  The first one would have the current inventory (only material cap.), and the second one would have the daily
  capabilities of the plant (according to available equipment/personnel). The "Daily Capabilities" PC could
  be cloned as a template to fill in the exact capabilities for each working day (already supported).

Ideas:

* maybe it'd be better to feed high-level process definitions to the system, instead of doing it by hand (DSL?)
* have a look at:
